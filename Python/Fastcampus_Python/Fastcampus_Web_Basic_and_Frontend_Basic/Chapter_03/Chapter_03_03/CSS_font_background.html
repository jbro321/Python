  <p>
    <em>A clean, elegant URL scheme</em> is an important detail in a
    high-quality Web application. Django lets you design URLs however you want,
    with no framework limitations.
  </p>

  <p>
    See <a href="#">Cool URIs don’t change</a>, by World Wide Web creator Tim
    Berners-Lee, for excellent arguments on why URLs should be clean and usable.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>
    To design URLs for an app, you create a Python module informally called a
    <strong>URLconf</strong> (URL configuration). This module is pure Python
    code and is a mapping between URL path expressions to Python functions (your
    views).
  </p>

  <p>
    This mapping can be as short or as long as needed. It can reference other
    mappings. And, because it’s pure Python code, it can be constructed
    dynamically.
  </p>

  <p>
    Django also provides a way to translate URLs according to the active
    language. See the internationalization documentation for more information.
  </p>

  <h2>How Django processes a request</h2>

  <p>
    When a user requests a page from your Django-powered site, this is the
    algorithm the system follows to determine which Python code to execute:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Django determines the root URLconf module to use. Ordinarily, this is the
      value of the <code>ROOT_URLCONF</code> setting, but if the incoming
      <code>HttpRequest</code> object has a <code>urlconf</code> attribute (set
      by middleware), its value will be used in place of the
      <code>ROOT_URLCONF</code> setting.
    </li>
    <li>
      Django loads that Python module and looks for the variable
      <code>urlpatterns</code>. This should be a Python list of
      <code>django.urls.path()</code> and/or
      <code>django.urls.re_path()</code> instances.
    </li>
    <li>
      Django runs through each URL pattern, in order, and stops at the first one
      that matches the requested URL.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once one of the URL patterns matches, Django imports and calls the given
      view, which is a simple Python function (or a class-based view). The view
      gets passed the following arguments:
      <ul>
        <li>An instance of <code>HttpRequest</code>.</li>
        <li>
          If the matched URL pattern returned no named groups, then the matches
          from the regular expression are provided as positional arguments.
        </li>
        <li>
          The keyword arguments are made up of any named parts matched by the
          path expression, overridden by any arguments specified in the optional
          <code>kwargs</code> argument to <code>django.urls.path()</code> or
          <code>django.urls.re_path()</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If no URL pattern matches, or if an exception is raised during any point
      in this process, Django invokes an appropriate error-handling view. See
      <a href="">Error handling</a> below.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>URL namespaces</h2>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>
    URL namespaces allow you to uniquely reverse
    <a href="">named URL patterns</a> even if different applications use the
    same URL names. It’s a good practice for third-party apps to always use
    namespaced URLs (as we did in the tutorial). Similarly, it also allows you
    to reverse URLs if multiple instances of an application are deployed. In
    other words, since multiple instances of a single application will share
    named URLs, namespaces provide a way to tell these named URLs apart.
  </p>

  <p>
    Django applications that make proper use of URL namespacing can be deployed
    more than once for a particular site. For example
    <code>django.contrib.admin</code> has an <code>AdminSite</code> class which
    allows you to easily deploy more than one instance of the admin. In a later
    example, we’ll discuss the idea of deploying the polls application from the
    tutorial in two different locations so we can serve the same functionality
    to two different audiences (authors and publishers).
  </p>

  <p>A URL namespace comes in two parts, both of which are strings:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>application namespace</dt>
    <dd>
      This describes the name of the application that is being deployed. Every
      instance of a single application will have the same application namespace.
      For example, Django’s admin application has the somewhat predictable
      application namespace of <code>'admin'</code>.
    </dd>
    <dt>instance namespace</dt>
    <dd>
      This identifies a specific instance of an application. Instance namespaces
      should be unique across your entire project. However, an instance
      namespace can be the same as the application namespace. This is used to
      specify a default instance of an application. For example, the default
      Django admin instance has an instance namespace of <code>'admin'</code>.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    Namespaced URLs are specified using the ':' operator. For example, the main
    index page of the admin application is referenced using
    <code>'admin:index'</code>. This indicates a namespace of
    <code>'admin'</code>, and a named URL of <code>'index'</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Namespaces can also be nested. The named URL
    <code>'sports:polls:index'</code> would look for a pattern named
    <code>'index'</code> in the namespace <code>'polls'</code> that is itself
    defined within the top-level namespace <code>'sports'</code>.
  </p>
